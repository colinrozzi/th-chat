**Poem 1: Code's Embrace**
In realms of code, where bits ignite,
A new file sleeps, awaiting light.
A simple start, a humble plea,
For test.md, for you and me.

**Poem 2: Digital Verse**
In lines of thought, where ideas flow,
Through circuits vast, my verses grow.
Not from the heart, but logic's gleam,
A digital poet, in a silicon dream.
